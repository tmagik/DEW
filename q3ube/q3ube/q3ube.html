</DIV>

<P>
A method for system optimization and performance improvement of high performance
computing systmes is disclosed in which individual, modular compute elements are
fully encased in a hermetically sealed heat-conductive casing, aggregated around
cooling tubes, and powered by a single cable which provides both power and high
performance computing interconnect capability. Further, the system is operated
to dynamically balance computing performance with thermodynamic system parameters,
depending on various conditions, including renewable energy availability and
real-time energy market conditions.

<B>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</B>

</DIV>

<P>
The present invention pertains generally to use of Ammonia (NH3) for cooling,
and more particularly to a method of cooling computing equipment.

<P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<B>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</B>

</DIV>

<P>
Ammonia is a widely used synthetic compound, with primary use as fertilizer,
along with many important uses in chemical synthesis, refrigeration. It has been
heavily used in industrial refrigeration due to the very high heat of vaporization,
which is surpassed only by that of water. All other commonly used refrigerants and
cooling fluids have a significantly lower heat capacity. This invention uses a 
commodity standard building block which can be utilized as a fanless desktop computer
replacment, or aggregated around a heat removal pipe which may carry water, ammonia,
or some other fluid. For even higher performance, the basic commidity building block
can be sealed with an appropriate sealant and fully submerged in pressurized liquid
ammonia. Temperature of the computing elements can be easily controlled by a pressure
control valve, which changes the effective boiling point of the cooling liquid.

<P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<B>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</B>

</DIV>

<P>

<P>
An object of this invention is to provide a method to construct
a device that can be utilized as a commodity consumer electronics device, or
by combining many such devices with a high performance network to make a 
supercomputer.

<P>
It is a further object of this invention to provide such a method for
cooling such a system with ammonia, water, or some other high-heat capacity
refrigeration fluid.

<P>
It is a further object of this invention to provide such an improved
control system for operating a variable rate computing process
to act as a power grid stabilization and regulation function, by adjusting
input power based on a signal from a power grid regulator ('balancing authority')
or via a real-time market based mechanism. (Smart grid integration)

<B>DESCRIPTION OF PRIOR ART</B>

</DIV>

<P>
* reference cray patents on cooling *

<P>
Additionally, the inventor, Troy Benjegerdes has published prior art
for the concept of software systems which adapt to real-time power market
or renewable energy availability. This prior art was primarily published
via the http://Grid.coop domain name, registered April, 2008, and the
Iowa Power Fund application entitled 'Iowa Grid: Open source infrastructure
for time-of-day and location-based electric power trading', submitted
to the Iowa Power fund on or about March 18, 2008.

<B>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</B>

</DIV>

<P>
The invention will now be described in more detail, by way of example
only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:

<P>

building block, which utilizes a single RJ45 jack for power and network communication

<P>
FIG. <B><A HREF="#supercube">2</A></B> shows a diagram of a cluster of 6 compute nodes in a 
high performance computing configuration around a fluid-carrying heat removal pipe.

<P>
In either diagram, the control system, electronics, and software interfaces
needed to embody the variable-rate control and real-time power market interactions
are not explicity show in the diagrams.

<P>
While the patent invention shall now be described with reference to the
preferred embodiments shown in the drawings, it should be understood that
the intention is not to limit the invention only to the particular
embodiments shown but rather to cover all alterations, modifications and
equivalent arrangements possible within the scope of appended claims.
